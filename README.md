- After you've made sure you have python installed
- ‎ 
- Go to the releases page

- After it's downloaded unzip it
- Copy the location of linux-run.sh (you can do this in GNOME files by pressing ctrl + c and in KDE Dolphin by pressing ctrl +  alt + c)
- Open your terminal and type ```chmod +x``` and after it paste the location of your linux-run.sh (if you downloaded the zip to your Downloads folder it should be ```/home/yourusername/Downloads/OpenShockClock-0.8.3/linux-run.sh```)
- After that paste your linux-run.sh location again and hit enter
